## Here’s a summary of the enhancements made to the game:

1. Image Change on Hit: The target image now switches between two images every time it is hit.
2. Game Continuation Prompt: After every three hits, a pop-up window appears asking the player if they want to continue the game. If the player chooses “No”, the game ends.
3. Smooth Target Movement: The target now moves smoothly across the screen, bouncing off the edges of the window. The speed of the target increases with each hit.
4. Score Display in Window Title: The game window’s title now updates with the current score, showing the number of hits and misses.
